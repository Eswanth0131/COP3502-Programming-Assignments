# Programming Assignments
This repository contains a series of programming assignments for the COP3502 course, focusing on foundational concepts in computer science and C programming. Each assignment builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental learning and skill development. The assignments demonstrate various aspects of programming, including data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

The provided code is well-commented to facilitate understanding and is structured to reflect best practices in software development. Additionally, detailed descriptions of each assignment can be found in the corresponding PDF files included in this repository. Students are encouraged to review the code, test the implementations, and experiment with modifications to deepen their understanding of the material.
